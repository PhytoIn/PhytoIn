\title{Stratified wood volume by DBH classes}
\usage{
stratvol(obj, classes = 20, shape.factor = 1, rm.dead = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{An object of class \code{"param"} produced by \code{\link{phytoparam}},
containing the inventory data, variable names, and global area statistics used for standardization.}

\item{classes}{Numeric vector of breakpoints (in centimeters) defining the DBH classes.
If a single value is supplied, two classes are formed (\eqn{\leq} value; \eqn{>} value). Defaults to 20.}

\item{shape.factor}{Stem form correction factor used in the individual volume calculation
(\eqn{V_i = ABi \times h \times shape.factor}). Default 1 (cylindrical shape).}

\item{rm.dead}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, individuals labeled as dead (rows whose taxon string equals
the \emph{dead} code stored in \code{obj$vars}) are excluded from all calculations. Default \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with one row per taxon and the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{Taxon}: Taxon label.
  \item One column per DBH class (labeled in centimeters), containing the summed wood volume per hectare (\eqn{m^3} \eqn{ha^{-1}})
  for that taxon within the class. Missing combinations are returned as 0.
}
}
\description{
\code{stratvol} computes wood volume (\eqn{m^3} \eqn{ha^{-1}}) stratified by diameter at breast height (DBH, in centimeters)
classes for each taxon in a forest inventory. Individual tree volume is calculated as
\eqn{V_i = ABi \times h \times shape.factor}, where \eqn{ABi} is the individual basal area at breast height
and \eqn{h} is tree height. Volumes are then summed within DBH classes and standardized per hectare using
the inventoried area stored in \code{obj}.
}
\details{
- DBH classes are defined from the numeric breakpoints provided in \code{classes}, using closed–open intervals internally
  and labeled for readability as: \code{<=a}, \code{]a-b]}, …, \code{>z} (all in centimeters).
- Individual volume is computed as \eqn{V_i = ABi \times h \times shape.factor}.
  Summed volumes per class are divided by the inventoried area (in hectares) retrieved from \code{obj$global}, yielding \eqn{m^3} \eqn{ha^{-1}}.
}
\note{
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Units:} Supply size classes in centimeters. The function assumes \code{ABi} and \code{h}
  yield volume in cubic meters before per-hectare standardization.
  \item \strong{Class limits:} Class breakpoints should not exceed the maximum observed DBH; otherwise the function stops with an error.

# Creating the 'param' object with phytosociological parameters

# Stratified volumes with a single breakpoint (<= 20 cm; > 20 cm)
stratvol(point.param, classes = 20)

# Stratified volumes with multiple classes (<= 5], ]5–10], > 10 cm)
stratvol(point.param, classes = c(5, 10))

# Using a taper/form correction factor and excluding dead trees
stratvol(point.param, classes = c(10, 20, 30), shape.factor = 0.7, rm.dead = TRUE)
