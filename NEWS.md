# PhytoIn 0.2.0

- New function summary.param() (S3) with concise and robust output.
- collector.curve() and rarefaction() now include confidence intervals (ribbons) and configurable themes.
- AGB() no longer depends on rappdirs; optional cache via tools::R_user_dir() and BIOMASS::createCache().
- BAplot() fixed (global bindings) and compatible with rectangular plots and individual coordinates.
- New datasets: quadrat2_plot.df, quadrat2_tree.df, quadrat3_rect.df.
- Documentation, examples, and NAMESPACE/DESCRIPTION revised.

## First public release on CRAN

- phytoparam(), summary.param(), plot.param() for phytosociological parameters and diversity indices.
- AGB() for aboveground biomass, carbon, and COâ‚‚ equivalent (wrapper of BIOMASS).
- stratvol() for stratified volume by DBH classes.
- collector.curve() for species accumulation curves.
- rarefaction() for individual-based rarefaction with confidence intervals.
- BAplot() for visualization of basal areas (rectangular plots and individual coordinates).
- Included datasets: quadrat.df, point.df, quadrat2_plot.df, quadrat2_tree.df, quadrat3_rect.df.

# PhytoIn 0.1.0 (development version)
